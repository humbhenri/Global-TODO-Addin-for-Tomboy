Global TODO 
-----------

This addin for tomboy when enabled checks every open note for the #TODO string. Every note with this string 
gets an entry in a note called "Global Todo". When the #TODO string is removed the entry is automatically 
removed.

Tomboy is a desktop note-taking application for Linux, Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X. Please refer to http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/.

Instalation
-----------

Tomboy and Tomboy addins are written in C# under the Mono platform. To compile the source you need the 
required packages that provide mono and tomboy development for your system. In fedora systems, install the package 
tomboy-devel with the command "yum install tomboy-devel". Once compiled move the .dll file into the tomboy 
addin folder - usually the directory ".config/tomboy/addins" under your user directory and restart tomboy. The 
plugin should appear in tomboy's plugins menu and must be activated to be used.

Usage
-----

The user just need to write #TODO inside a note to put it automatically inside the note "Global Todo". The 
"Global Todo" note tracks all notes with the #TODO inside.
